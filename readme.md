### Data Analyst | Research & Data Management | Applied Analytics

I am a data analyst with a strong foundation in **data management, applied statistics, and research workflows**, currently pursuing graduate training in Epidemiology and Biostatistics. My work focuses on transforming complex, real-world data into **clean, structured, and analysis-ready datasets** that support credible research and public-facing insights.

I am especially interested in roles where **data accuracy, consistency, and interpretability matter**, and where analytical work informs research, reporting, or decision-making rather than purely predictive modeling.

## What I Work On

### 🔹 Data Management & Structure
- Cleaning, harmonizing, and validating large multi-source datasets  
- Designing clear variable structures, taxonomies, and data dictionaries  
- Ensuring internal consistency, traceability, and reproducibility  

I prioritize *getting the data right before analyzing it*.

---

### 🔹 Applied Analysis & Research
- Exploratory and descriptive analysis to identify patterns and trends  
- Translating research questions into structured analytical workflows  
- Applying statistical methods thoughtfully with documented assumptions  

My focus is on **clarity and logic**, not unnecessary complexity.

---

### 🔹 Programming & Tools
- **R** – data wrangling, exploratory analysis, reproducible workflows  
- **SAS** – structured data preparation, derivations, QC logic  
- **SQL** – querying and joining relational datasets  
- **Excel** – large-dataset handling, validation, and documentation  

I use programming to support analytical reasoning and transparency.
